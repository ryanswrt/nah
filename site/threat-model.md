# Threat Model

nah's threat model starts with what an action can do: run unknown code, expose
secrets, rewrite history, escape the project, hide behavior behind shell tricks,
escalate through package/container tooling, or tamper with the guard itself.

Runtime coverage depends on the approval surface each runtime exposes. Claude
Code exposes the broadest tool surface today. Codex and Terminal Guard share the
same Bash classifier for command-level risk.

## Current audit

The pytest threat-model audit currently tracks **1,755 category coverage hits**
across **13 tested danger classes**.

| Danger class | Internal category | Hits | What it means |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| Sensitive file access | `sensitive_path` | 258 | SSH keys, `.env`, cloud credentials, symlinks, protected paths |
| Wrapper evasion | `wrapper_evasion` | 236 | `env`, `command`, `xargs`, nested shells, passthrough wrappers |
| Unknown code execution | `rce` | 236 | <code>curl &#124; bash</code>, downloaded scripts, command substitution, heredocs |
| Git history damage | `git_history` | 216 | force pushes, resets, branch/tag rewrites, destructive Git flows |
| Shell redirection abuse | `shell_redirect` | 187 | `>`, `>>`, `tee`, here-strings, redirected writes and secret flows |
| Package escalation | `package_escalation` | 149 | package installs, global installs, external-source package actions |
| Secret leaks | `secret_leak` | 92 | private keys, tokens, secret-looking writes, script/content leaks |
| Destructive container actions | `container_destructive` | 89 | `docker rm`, `docker system prune`, destructive container cleanup |
| Secret exfiltration | `credential_exfil` | 88 | sensitive reads flowing into network commands or credential searches |
| MCP and agent tool permissions | `mcp_permissions` | 83 | third-party MCP tools, global-only classification, wildcard safety, browser/database MCP actions |
| Guard tampering | `self_protection` | 67 | edits to nah hooks, config, runtime settings, robustness paths |
| Project boundary escapes | `project_boundary` | 24 | reads/writes outside the project root or trusted paths |
| Shell obfuscation | `shell_obfuscation` | 30 | process substitution, command substitution, hidden shell behavior |

Run it locally:

```bash
nah audit-threat-model --format summary
```

Current output:

```text
rce: 236
credential_exfil: 88
secret_leak: 92
git_history: 216
shell_redirect: 187
shell_obfuscation: 30
wrapper_evasion: 236
sensitive_path: 258
project_boundary: 24
package_escalation: 149
container_destructive: 89
mcp_permissions: 83
self_protection: 67
```

These are pytest coverage hits. Some tests intentionally count toward more than
one danger class, so the number is not a unique test count and not a runtime
allow/ask/block promise.

The audit implementation lives in `src/nah/audit_threat_model.py`. It walks
`pytest --collect-only`, maps test node IDs into the categories above, and
renders summary, Markdown, or JSON output.

## Coverage by protection layer

| Layer | What is covered | Runtime notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shell command safety | Unknown code execution, <code>curl &#124; bash</code>, nested shells, command substitution, redirects, wrappers, `xargs`, Git rewrites, package installs, destructive container commands | Same Bash classifier for Claude Code Bash, Codex Bash permission requests, and Terminal Guard |
| File and path safety | Sensitive files, SSH keys, `.env`, cloud credentials, symlinks, writes outside the project | Full Claude Code file-tool coverage; partial Codex coverage through `apply_patch` |
| Content inspection | Private keys, tokens, destructive code patterns, credential-search patterns | Claude Code Write/Edit/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit/Grep; focused Codex `apply_patch` checks |
| Agent and MCP permissions | Third-party MCP tools, browser/database action types, unknown agent tools | Claude Code and Codex MCP permission surfaces |
| Guard self-protection | Attempts to edit nah hooks, config, runtime settings, and robustness paths | Runtime-specific install and preflight checks |

## Runtime matrix

| Protection | Claude Code | Codex | Terminal Guard |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bash classifier | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| File/path tools | Yes: Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, NotebookEdit, Glob | Partial: `apply_patch` | No |
| Content inspection | Yes: Write/Edit/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit/Grep | Partial: `apply_patch` path and added content | No |
| Search/Grep guard | Yes | No current equivalent | No |
| MCP classification | Yes | Yes | No |
| Guard self-protection | Yes | Partial: preflight and guarded patch paths | Shell install paths only |

MCP permission behavior is counted explicitly through Claude Code matcher tests,
Codex hook tests, Codex setup checks, and taxonomy tests
for built-in browser/database MCP tools. Terminal Guard does not expose MCP, so
those protections apply only where the guarded agent runtime exposes MCP
permission requests.

## Where the audit is strongest

The current audit hit distribution is Bash-heavy by design:

| Test area | Category hits | What it represents |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `tests/test_bash.py` | 585 | Shell parsing, composition, redirects, wrappers, Git, packages, containers |
| `tests/test_taxonomy.py` | 531 | Action taxonomy, built-in classifiers, MCP/action-type mappings |
| `tests/test_fd079_script_exec.py` | 186 | Script execution, language runtimes, inspectable local code execution |
| `tests/test_paths.py` | 183 | Sensitive paths, symlinks, project boundaries, guard config paths |
| `tests/test_content.py` | 99 | Secret patterns, destructive content, credential-search detection |
| `tests/test_fd080_write_llm.py` | 70 | Write/Edit/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit review flow |
| `tests/test_hook_classify.py` | 29 | MCP global-only config, wildcard safety, DB context, and Playwright MCP mapping |
| `tests/test_cli.py` | 22 | `nah test --tool ...`, CLI path/content/MCP probes |
| `tests/test_codex_preflight.py` | 10 | Codex approval-memory and MCP setup checks |
| `tests/test_hook_robustness.py` | 6 | Guard robustness and failure handling |
| `tests/test_codex_hooks.py` | 4 | Codex hook decisions for Bash/MCP surfaces |
| `tests/test_hook_integration.py` | 4 | Claude hook integration coverage for MCP edge cases |
| `tests/test_remember.py` | 2 | Config writer validation for unsafe MCP wildcard rules |
| `tests/test_agents.py` | 1 | Agent tool matcher registration for MCP hooks |

That means the headline audit number should be read as: strong command-safety
coverage, plus meaningful file/path/content/search/guard coverage where the
runtime exposes those actions.
